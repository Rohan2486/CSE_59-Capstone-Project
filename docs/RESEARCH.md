## Disclaimer

Water footprint values represent global averages based on available scientific literature. Actual water footprints may vary significantly based on:
- Geographic location and climate
- Production methods and technology
- Supply chain efficiency
- Seasonal variations
- Local water scarcity conditions

Users should consider these values as educational estimates rather than precise measurements for specific products or regions.
